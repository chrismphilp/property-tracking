# Property-Tracking

This application is deployed to GAE, and is used to track property prices in certain areas within London for future reference. This can be deployed for free based on the current gcloud pricing structure, and the locations can be set to any areas. 

A separate cron job runs this main workflow every day.

Feel free to fork this for your own purposes.
